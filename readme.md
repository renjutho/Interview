# Technical Test #

## What do we want you to do? ##
You will be provided with a skeleton WebApi solution based on a standard VS template that you can extend as you wish.

We want you to create a REST API for a simple data set that we will provide (**data.json**).

The REST API should allow for the following actions on the resource:
 
- create
- read
- update 
- delete 

We would like to see data access to the json file, no need for databases.


## Other Considerations ##

You should follow industry best practices and consider: 

- separation of concerns
- testability
- security (the API will be publicly accessible)
- scalability 
- performance.

Ideally at the end of this process your solution will be structured, readable and maintainable; and importantly **executable** on Windows.
